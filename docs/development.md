# Development

## Build dependencies

The production game is the Amiga executable; there is no host game renderer.

- GNU make, a shell and Python 3 (plus `capstone` for the 68k sweeps).
- `m68k-amiga-elf-gcc/g++`, `elf2hunk`, vasm and Amiga NDK headers.
- `unar` and `hfsutils` to extract the original release.

`amiga/env.sh` adds the development toolchain under `~/.local` to PATH.
FS-UAE launchers use `${FSUAE_COMMON:-$HOME/.local/share/amiga/fsuae_common.sh}`
for shared, PID-scoped emulator/debug-port management; it is an external
developer dependency, shared with the other ports on this host. `KICKSTART`
selects your local boot ROM. `tools/ghidra` links to the shared Ghidra install.

```sh
. amiga/env.sh
make -C amiga clean
make -C amiga -j4
```

The output is `amiga/out/Alone.exe`. The build needs no copyrighted input.
Always clean when changing build flags or shared headers. Every link runs two audits:
`no-float-audit` (no libgcc floating-point helpers) and `probe-audit` (every
debugger-read global survives `--gc-sections`). C/C++ uses
`-m68020 -mtune=68020 -msoft-float`; GNU as uses `-mcpu=68020 -mno-float`
(it has no `-mtune` option). Integer multiplication/division uses native C/C++;
the 68000 helper header is retired.

## Original data

Put your original archive in ignored `tmp/`, then:

```sh
make extract-original-data ARCHIVE=tmp/AloneInTheDark.img_.sit
make segments
```

The first writes `tmp/runtime-data/Alone In The Dark` (the raw resource fork)
and `tmp/runtime-data/Alone Data/`; see [install-original-data.md](install-original-data.md).
The second dumps the CODE resources to `tmp/segments/` for the 68k sweeps and
Ghidra.

## Running

```sh
cd amiga
. ./env.sh
./run.sh
```

The default and sole active configuration is `a1200-020`: A1200, 68EC020,
AGA, 2 MB chip / 8 MB fast, no FPU/MMU/JIT. Other CPU configurations fail
with `CONFIG / DEFERRED CPU TARGET`; their support is deferred to M5.0.
All three launchers share these settings and write the emulator core log to
`amiga/.run/logs/fs-uae.log.txt`.

`stage_original_data.sh` copies the extracted files next to the executable on
the emulated hard drive; override `AITD_APP_RSRC` and `AITD_DATA_DIR` for other
layouts.

## Debugging

```sh
cd amiga
. ./env.sh
make clean && make -j4 PROBES=1
EXTRA_ARGS="--warp_mode=1" GDBSCRIPT=runtime_status.gdb ./diag_run.sh 60
```

The runner stops early when an event-driven observer finishes; otherwise its
seconds argument is a safety ceiling, not proof of success. It stops only the
emulator it owns and keeps the output in `amiga/.run/gdb-out.log`.
`runtime_status.gdb` reports the stage, tick counters and the loud stop: the
loader's reason and segment, or the trap word, manager, routine and caller
(segment, offset). `wbstartup.gdb` checks the Shell startup branch.
`./debug.sh` gives an interactive source-level session.

The current display owner is `AitdScreen`; the interpreter boundary is
`MacLoader`. Keep changes at the documented interface and verify original
opcodes/operands before changing binary behavior.

## Static analysis

```sh
make host-tests         # host analysis fixtures
make trap-census        # tmp/trap-census.md, live sites and selectors
make m68k-sweep         # 68020-only instructions on reachable paths
make lowmem-scan        # reachable absolute Page-0 references
make entrypoints-check  # ghidra_scripts/entrypoints.csv matches CODE 0
```

The census and low-memory scan read the original resource fork directly, including
CREL, DATA, ZERO and DREL; no scratch scripts or Vette checkout are needed.
The census checks the 1.0 baseline of 1,118 sites / 243 distinct trap words.
Its 115 unresolved static transfers/decode stops remain listed for runtime
verification. D0 selectors are local static evidence, not a data-flow proof.

`lowmem-scan` reports 56 live Page-0 operands at 28 addresses, with original
encodings. CREL address fields and PEA address constants are excluded; genuine
memory operands in the same instruction remain visible. This conservative set
includes fallback paths (such as SysEnvirons glue); M1.4 must reconcile those
with the implemented system services before producing its patch table.

Trap names come from cxmon through `tools/gen_trap_names.py`, reused from Vette.
The generated `tmp/trap_names.lua` remains local-only. The generator accepts a
local cxmon `mon_atraps.h` path for offline use; otherwise it downloads the table.

`ghidra_scripts/` holds the headless Ghidra scripts used by Vette!
(entry marking, names, trap and call-graph dumps, listing export). Their
output belongs under ignored `tmp/` or `disasm/`.

The MAME runtime logger and its bounded session are documented in
[mac-reference-loop.md](mac-reference-loop.md#runtime-trap-evidence).
`make mac-trap-map` generates local original-byte metadata; the report attributes
calls using per-record live jump-table targets and rejects missing state proofs.
M0.2 added the runtime-confirmed CODE 1 cache helper at `$021E`/`$026E` to the
census: `$A0BD` was the new distinct trap; `$A346`/`$A746` were new sites for
already-known words. The original bytes are checked before these extra roots
are walked. The additional low-memory operands both access `CPUFlag` (`$012F`).

M0.3 verification: clean 68020 build linked with `no-float-audit: clean` and
`probe-audit: clean (33 symbols)`. A real soft-float compilation fixture was
rejected for `__addsf3` and `__floatsidf`. A bounded A1200/68020 diagnostic run
reached the unchanged `SEGMENT LOADER / CREL RELOCATION`, CODE 3, state 2,
10 jump entries. This is the expected current stop, not a gameplay/boot pass.

M0.4 verification: clean build and both link audits pass (30 retained probes);
the `PROBES=1 FILLWATCH=1` clean build also passes (78 probes).
The bounded 68020 run still reaches the CODE 3 CREL relocation stop. Captures
made immediately after drawing that same stop compare byte-for-byte equal:
98,304 planar bytes. The launcher now matches its documented A1200, 2 MB chip /
8 MB fast configuration. The eight-plane game display remains M2.4 work.

The Shell message `cannot read Alone In The Dark` / returncode 20 is a startup
failure, not the expected CREL stop. It covers file open, size, allocation and
read failures. Check the staged file and OS-visible memory; the exploratory
68040 configuration produced this failure with its fast RAM unconfigured.

M0.6 verification (68020-only scope per owner): clean build and both audits
pass (30 probes). The bounded default run reports emulator CPU=68020,
FPU/MMU/JIT=0, 24-bit addressing, Exec.AttnFlags=$0003, and 8 MB Z2 fast RAM
at $00200000. It reaches `SEGMENT LOADER / CREL RELOCATION`, CODE 3, state 2,
10 jump entries, before the 45-second ceiling. Shell syntax checks pass;
deferred CPU selections and conflicting CPU overrides are rejected. This is
configuration acceptance only, not the still-unimplemented boot regression.
