# Native SoundMusicSys driver

D8 replaces the original software mixer at its driver interface. The native
implementation is still pending; production stops before any MDRV body is
loaded. This document records the measured startup contract (M2.1c3c1), not
native or audio acceptance.

## Installation seam

Original Core+$10CC first requests `Jnth` with the selected driver ID (11 here)
at +$10E2. A found resource is detached and returned without decryption. Only a
missing Jnth takes the MDRV request at +$1102, decrypt and decompression path.
Core+$1CC6 calls this loader. The original then moves, makes nonpurgeable and
locks the handle; **+$1CF4** stores its body pointer at A5−$6AC. A port-owned
Jnth resource can therefore supply the D8 entry without changing game code.

`check_driver_startup.py` guards the original loader, caller and both argument
setup/call/cleanup sequences by SHA-256. The live, decrypted reference driver
saved before initialization is exactly 29,256 bytes and matches the existing
original unpacked driver, SHA-256
`3880a65dcdf4ece9c5e91712ce0af9866b0dcc435bd09fc5ad536eff2b70b470`.
It is local-only evidence and must never be shipped or committed.

## Measured startup calls

The entry reads selector at 4(SP), argument at 8(SP). It saves D2–D7/A0–A6;
D0 returns the zero-extended 16-bit status, and D1 is scratch. The caller removes
8 argument bytes after RTS. Both reached calls return status zero and preserve
D2–D7/A0–A6 and the pre-JSR SP, verified independently for each call.

| Selector | Original call | Argument | Resulting reference state | D0 / D1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 21 ($15) | Core+$1D46 | Pointer to words 6, 2, 2 | Song/normalized/effect limits 6/2/2; quality flag 0; rate fields $0172/1 | 0 / 0 |
| 24 ($18) | Core+$1D60 | $010B | Same voice limits; quality flag 1; rate fields $00B9/0 | 0 / 1 |

The semantic names of the three initialization parameters come from Halestorm's
published [SoundMusicSystem.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Blzut3/Wolf3D-Mac/master/SoundMusicSystem.h).
Internal selector numbers and their effects come from the original bytes and
capture, not that public wrapper header. Selector 21 copies the three words at
driver+$0398 and initializes its state and voice storage. Selector 24 decodes
bits 8/9 as interpolation mode and the low byte as output rate: $0B selects the
11 kHz branch at +$030E. The native implementation must store the interface
configuration and initialize real native state; D8 does not require creating
the Mac software mixer or its hardware buffers. Unimplemented requests remain
named stops. Playback and channel allocation acceptance remain M4.

The driver state base is body+$4200: voice limits at +$11C0/+2/+4, quality byte
at +$30, status word +$08, and the two observed rate words +$60/+68. The Mac's
24-bit locked handle yields a raw entry pointer with bit 31 set. Execution
breakpoints must use the raw address or, as this probe does, the original
call sites; masking the execution address missed both calls in a rejected run.

After exactly these two calls, original Dan1+$0038 returns Times ID 20. The
probe requires both call/return pairs before accepting that endpoint. This
proves the original startup prerequisite, not later selector coverage.

## Reproduce and validate

Use the existing System 7.5.5 reference volume and generated trap map. Clear the
previous dump before starting; the checker requires the new live dump, exact
call order and arguments, register/stack equality, state and original bytes.

```sh
. amiga/env.sh
rm -f tmp/m2-driver-original.bin
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy timeout -k 5 90 mame maciix \
  -rompath ref/mame/roms -nb9 mdc48 -ramsize 8M \
  -hard ref/mame/hd/aitd_755.hd -video none -sound none -window \
  -skip_gameinfo -nothrottle -seconds_to_run 180 \
  -snapshot_directory ref/mame/snap -cfg_directory ref/mame/cfg \
  -nvram_directory ref/mame/nvram -debug -debugger none -oslog \
  -autoboot_script tools/mac_driver_startup.lua \
  >tmp/m2-driver-startup-reference.log 2>&1
run_status=$?
python3 tools/check_driver_startup.py tmp/m2-driver-startup-reference.log \
  --status "$run_status"
```

The probe changes no original instructions, driver state or RNG. It supplies
mouse input for the original size dialog and uses internal debugger reads;
no host window access is involved. A timeout, absent/duplicate call, wrong
state, changed preserved register, missing dump or missing positive completion
fails. Host rejection fixtures run in `make host-tests`.
